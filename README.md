# TDD-To-do-Natalia-Gareth FAC26


This was built as part of a pre-apprenticeship FAC26 project on Test Driven Development (TDD). The code was written using HTMP, CSS and JS.<br>

### Our code does two things.

1. Our code base explores the uses of TDD and technically how one would build a project that uses the TDD workflow. 
2. Our finished product will give the end user the ability to add, delete and toggle the tasks current state.

### What we have implemented so far.

1. User can add task.
2. User can specify whether task is complete
3. User can delete the task.
4. This project stores tasks in local storage
